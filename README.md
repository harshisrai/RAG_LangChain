# RAG from Scratch using LangChain

This repository contains the notebooks used during the **"Learn RAG from Scratch"** course on [freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/sVcwVQRHIc8), taught by a LangChain software engineer. In this course, you'll learn how to build a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, integrating your custom data with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Course Overview

The course covers the following key concepts and techniques:
- **Query Construction**: How to formulate questions or information requests that align with your data and model.
- **Query Translation**: Techniques for translating user queries into forms that are more understandable to the retrieval system.
- **Routing**: Methods for directing queries to the correct data source or sub-system.
- **Indexing**: Building efficient and searchable indexes of your data for fast retrieval.
- **Retrieval**: How to retrieve the most relevant pieces of data based on user queries.
- **Generation**: Using Large Language Models to generate human-like responses based on retrieved data.
